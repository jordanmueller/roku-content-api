Streaming Content API

Django app to manage the available content for a roku channel

This is a RESTful webservice producing JSON data to describe coursework available for streaming from the Harvard University Division of Continuing Education.

Wrote this API as part of my [Master's Thesis] (https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By_L4DYGXp_fZWg2aUZHazUxQk0/edit?usp=sharing )
